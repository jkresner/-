# ⌆ 
 
This project does not have a[n official] speakable name. There exist many words in various languages to best describe it. In English you would probably called it "perspective"

## What is it for?

The [unrealized] concept is a personal silo expressing how the owner sees [i.e. views, perceives, understands, comprehends] reality.


At this point it's 

1. my personal textual ⚭ protocol playground
2. essentially a free form relational index of thought(?s) based on {text, file-system, code [md], language [word based]} constructs. 
   ... Think spacing, markdown (markup), linguistic meaning


If people are interested in evolving it to be accessible for use by others, that'd be interstellar in my ⌆ 😁


The goal is to eventually 

1. extend well beyond the prehistoric constructs of apps and websites. [*"Where we're going, we don't need... road's"*]
2. give users full control and autonomy to
    1. own/store their own perspectives where they with, rather than host them with corporations / governments
    2. create "view-ports" [projections of the perspective] to share with parties / tools [like advertisers]
    3. plug-in/remove "view-ports" from technology to leverage benefits of personalization without compromising privacy
